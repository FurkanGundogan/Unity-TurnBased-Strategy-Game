# Turn Based Strategy

     It's a 3D game that i developed while following Udemy course.
     Main goal is eliminate all enemy units with your squad.
     To do this, you must attack strategically using your points while it is your turn. 
     When it is the enemy's turn, AI will attack you in the most optimal way.
